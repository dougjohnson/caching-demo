== A simple app demonstrating low-level caching in Rails

first of all:

<tt>apt-get install memcached</tt>

now:

<tt>bundle install</tt>

<tt>rake db:schema:load</tt>

<tt>rails s</tt>

Watch the logs while you navigate around the app performing CRUD actions on Posts
and marvel at the lack of unecessary database queries.
